# 🎉 Welcome to Shatha Altasan's Portfolio 🎉

Hey there! 👋 This is the place where I show off all the cool stuff I’ve been working on as a fresh Computer Science grad! From programming wizardry to face-detection magic 🧙‍♀️, I’ve packed this site with everything you need to know about me.

## 🚀 What’s Inside?

- **🏡 Home**: A quick “Hey, this is me!” complete with my smiling face, LinkedIn, GitHub, and a few ways to reach out. No carrier pigeons, though… 🐦
  
- **🙋‍♀️ About Me**: Want to know more about my journey through Computer Science? Here’s where I spill the beans! 🍲
  
- **💻 Projects**:
  - **Face Detection & Recognition System**: I built a system that recognizes faces in real-time using Python! No, it won’t recognize your cat 🐱... yet.
  - **Pong Game**: A modern twist on the retro game Pong 🕹️ made with C#. Let’s just say I got pretty good at paddle bouncing.
  
- **🛠️ Skills**: All the tech wizardry I’ve learned, from coding languages to AI shenanigans. ✨
  
- **📞 Contact**: Want to collaborate, chat about tech, or just say hi? My email, phone, and social links are all here. Don't be a stranger! 👽

## 🛠️ Built With:

- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: The building blocks that make everything look awesome. 🎨
- **AOS (Animate on Scroll)**: Because who doesn’t love a fancy scroll effect? ✨
- **jQuery**: I make the web dynamic and fun, like magic but with more semicolons. 🧙‍♂️
- **Typed.js**: Watch my text type itself like it’s alive. 👻
- **SweetAlert & EmailJS**: Fun little alerts and email sending powers. Who needs owls when you’ve got EmailJS? 🦉
